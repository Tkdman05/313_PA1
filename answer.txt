Filesize | Execution Time
---------|------
1MB      | 0m0.818s
10MB     | 0m3.986s
100MB    | 0m18.042s
500MB    | 4m29.709s

After attempting the transfer of 1, 10, 100, and 500MB files, I observed the execution time 
to be increasing with the size of the file. This is undoubtably due to the size of the buffer,
as the larger the file, the more chunks the server and client must pass through, meaning more
requests and responses as size increases.
